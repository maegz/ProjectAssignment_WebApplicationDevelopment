    Short description of the project:
        I've decided to create a game search-engine with the base of IGDB and Wikipedia.
        The user is supposed to search for a game, get alternatives that are related to the search
        and then be able to get information about the games in text and images.

    Technologies I've used:
        HTML5
        CSS
        Bootstrap
        JavaScript with jQuery
        Ajax

    APIs:
        Internet Game Database (IGDB): https://igdb.github.io/api/about/welcome/

        MediaWiki for Wikipedia: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page


    Work process:
        First of all I had to find an interesting API that would appeal to me. I checked through Mashape and finally stumbled on the IGDB API
        and directly thought it would fit. It would be a challenge of different methods to take out all the different parts of the game info
        and the styling could be done in so many different ways.

        I started with a planning of the structure and design of the page, doing a rough HTML and CSS setup. Then I took out the API parts
        with JavaScript and AJAX, doing some checkups with console.log's to see the whole objects. Starting to connect and tweeking all the
        variables with the DOM, a structure finally showed up.

        I've been working for a desktop-view for the moment, but will adjust it for good mobile experience as well in the end.

        I've noticed that some stuff are missing in the IGDB database, like summarys and screenshots, which can give the user an
        unpleasant experience when trying to look up a game. This I will try to fix with either MediaWiki or some other API that I
        find that can fulfill the searches.
